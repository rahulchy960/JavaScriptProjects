let speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();: This creates a new instance of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance object, which represents text that the speech synthesis service can read aloud.

let voices = []; let voiceSelect = document.querySelector("select");: These lines declare variables to store the available voices and reference the <select> element in the HTML document.

window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged: This event listener triggers when the list of available voices changes. Inside its callback function, it updates the voices array with the new list of voices and assigns the first voice to the speech object.

voiceSelect.addEventListener("change", () => {...}): This event listener triggers when the user selects a different voice from the dropdown menu. It updates the speech object's voice property to the selected voice.

document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {...}): This event listener triggers when the user clicks the button. It sets the text property of the speech object to the content of the <textarea> element and invokes window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech) to read the text aloud using the selected voice.
